# EcoGrow

Welcome to EcoGrow, a fictional project developed for personal portfolio purposes. This project aims to demonstrate skills in frontend web development, responsive design practices and good coding practices. Furthermore, it offers a view of what a backend could be for this type of application.

## ðŸŒ±Project description:

EcoGrow was designed as a fictional platform for gardening enthusiasts and beginners looking for a unique experience of growing their own herbs, edible flowers and microgreens at home. The project features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, offering detailed information about products and encouraging users to start their gardening journey.

## ðŸŒ±Technologies used:

- **HTML5/CSS3:** Used to structure and style web pages, ensuring an attractive visual presentation and a pleasant user experience.
- **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity to pages, such as opening modals, manipulating data and making requests to simulate an interaction with a backend.

## ðŸŒ±Functionalities:

- **Product Presentation:** EcoGrow features a selection of urban garden kits, each with a detailed description, eye-catching images, and "Learn More" buttons to provide additional information.
- **Details Modal:** When you click the "Learn More" button, a modal opens, revealing detailed information about the product, including title, description, images and specific features.
- **Responsiveness:** The website is fully responsive, adapting to a variety of devices and screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across desktops, tablets and smartphones.
- **Backend Simulation:** Although EcoGrow does not have a real backend implemented, a simulation of data submission is done when filling out and submitting the contact form. The data is sent to a local JSON file, demonstrating the intention for future implementation of a backend.
